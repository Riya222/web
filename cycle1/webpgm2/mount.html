<p>Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. Flowers have petals. 
Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.
We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out.</p>
