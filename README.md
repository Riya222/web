###Report on git operations
Firstly, created a team consists of 4 members, our team leader created an empty repository and invited as to collaborate into the repository.We the team members cloned the remote repository.First commit was created by the master and then we pull the master origin into our local repository.Then we add our files as "git add.filename" and committed the file using a meaningful commit message.Finally pushed the file into the remote repository using "git push origin".
Each member created their respective branches and committed inside the branch then, push the branch to the master node and viewed the same.
After completing all the creations of branches we merged the branches to the master node to make it available to other team members.
These branches are viewed as a graph using the command "git log --graph --oneline --all".
